                    processing it and try to make the delivery as soon as possible. But, sometimes in the delivery process
                    some glitches happen. There can be some political issues, country environment or natural calamities that
                    will slow us down but we ensure that the delivery is being made perfectly. So, if there any delay in the
                    delivery process please don't be impatient, know that we are trying our best to deliver your happiness

                <h3 class="h4 text-left block-title">Risk of Loss</h3>
    
                <p>All items purchased from Boibhandar.com are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the
                    Risk of Loss shall remain with Boibhandar.com until the item is transferred to you. In the event that
                    the items are damaged after receipt, the risk falls on the customer.</p>
    
    
                <h3 class="h4 text-left block-title">Fraud Protection Policy</h3>
    
                <p>Boibhandar.com realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection and resolution capability. We and our
                    Mobile Banking (bKash) payment partner monitor transactions continuously for suspicious activity and
                    flag potentially fraudulent transactions for manual verification by our team.<br>In the rarest of rare
                    cases, when our team is unable to rule out the possibility of fraud categorically, the transaction is
                    kept on hold, and the customer is requested to provide identity documents. The ID documents help us
                    ensure that the purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder. We apologize for any inconvenience
                    that may be caused to customers and request them to bear with us in the larger interest of ensuring a
                    safe and secure environment for online transactions.</p>
